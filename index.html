        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
            Despite advancements made in technology and medicine, access to proper healthcare remains limited for many Filipinos, possibly contributing to the country's high mortality rate up to this date.
        </div>
        <div>
            As such, we intend to use this study to examine the factors influencing healthcare accessibility and to determine its correlation, if significant, with Filipino mortality rates, shedding light on the disparities in healthcare availability across different regions.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <div>
            Throughout the years, accessibility to healthcare and basic health services continue to be scarce and uneven in the Philippines.
        </div>
        <div>
            In April of 2024, the World Health Organization stated that almost 800 million people in the Western Pacific region, including the Philippines, have insufficient access to basic healthcare services. This is further seen in the continuous increase of household expenditures from ₱686.49 billion in 2023 to ₱754.54 billion in 2024. Although the amount of facilities have increased, totaling to 40,108 health facilities in the country as of January 2024, this remains disproportionate among regions with CALABARZON having 4,415 facilities while other regions such as NCR and CAR having 2,784 and 1,278 facilities respectively.

    <div class="problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        The inaccessibility of proper healthcare for many Filipinos has been exacerbated by the lacking amount of facilities and professionals in the industry as well as the increasing pricing of healthcare itself.
    </div>
    <div class="solutions">
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        Our solution is to make use of data science methods and tools to analyze these factors that affect the accessibility of healthcare among Filipinos as a way to gain insights of the current situation of our healthcare system, giving way for feasible solutions to be implemented.

        <h2>Hypotheses</h2>
        <div>
            Null: There is little to no correlation between the amount of operational health facilities in a region and the region’s corresponding mortality rates.

            Alternative: There is a significant correlation between the amount of operational health facilities in a region and the region’s corresponding mortality rates.
