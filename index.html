                Overview
            </div>
            <div class="text-heavy">
                Despite advancements made in technology and medicine, access to proper healthcare remains limited for many Filipinos, possibly contributing to the country's high mortality rate up to this date.
            </div>
            <div class="text-support">
                As such, we intend to use this study to examine the factors influencing healthcare accessibility and to determine its correlation, if significant, with Filipino mortality rates, shedding light on the disparities in healthcare availability across different regions.

                    Throughout the years, accessibility to healthcare and basic health services continue to be scarce and uneven in the Philippines.
                </div>
                <div class="text-support">
                    In April of 2024, the World Health Organization stated that almost 800 million people in the Western Pacific region, including the Philippines, have insufficient access to basic healthcare services. This is further seen in the continuous increase of household expenditures from ₱686.49 billion in 2023 to ₱754.54 billion in 2024. Although the amount of facilities have increased, totaling to 40,108 health facilities in the country as of January 2024, this remains disproportionate among regions with CALABARZON having 4,415 facilities while other regions such as NCR and CAR having 2,784 and 1,278 facilities respectively.

                        The inaccessibility of proper healthcare for many Filipinos has been exacerbated by the lacking amount of facilities and professionals in the industry as well as the increasing pricing of healthcare itself.

            <div class="desc">
                We began our exploration by taking the master list of active health facilities, cleaning and normalizing each “Region” label, then computing a new “Total Facilities” column (summing hospitals, RHUs, barangay stations, birthing homes, etc.). Next, we grouped that table by region and plotted a simple vertical bar chart of total facilities per region. That visualization let us immediately spot which regions (e.g. Region IVA, Region V) had the largest networks of clinics and which (e.g. BARMM, Region IX) had the fewest, guiding our subsequent per-capita and mortality-rate analyses.

                A scatter plot with each region having a dedicated data point. Each point's x-value is the region's health facility density ( [amt. of health facilities / total population of the region] * 10000) and its y-value is its respective mortality rate ( [amt. of deaths / total population of the region] * 10000). A best fit line created using least squares regression shows a positive relationship between a region's health facility density and its mortality rate.

            We employed the Pearson's r correlation coefficient test to test for the correlation of the independent variable of our study, the health facility density of a region (per 10,000 people), with the dependent variable of our study, which is the mortality rate of a region (per 10,000 people). We executed this test using Python, as well as a CSV created from our dataset with the data for Region Name, Deaths, Population, Mortality Rate (MR), and Health Facility Density (HFD) -- which were used in creating the graph for Research Question 3. With this test, we found a correlation coefficient of 0.169, suggesting that there is indeed a correlation between HFD and MR. This is also confirmed by the following graph which shows a sizable amount of data points close to the best fit line.
